# Ethiopia Financial Inclusion Forecasting System (2025-2027)

## Overview
This project, developed for **Selam Analytics**, aims to forecast the digital financial transformation in Ethiopia. Using time series methods and event-impact modeling, we track two core dimensions:
1. **Access**: Account Ownership Rate (World Bank Global Findex)
2. **Usage**: Digital Payment Adoption Rate

## Current Baseline (2024-2025)
- **Account Ownership**: 49% (Global Findex 2024/2025)
- **Mobile Money**: 54M+ Telebirr users, 10M+ Safaricom/M-Pesa users.
- **Key Trend**: Transaction volumes have skyrocketed, but unique account ownership has shown a 2021-2024 slowdown (+3pp).

## Folder Structure
